        Happy Thanksgiving! I found a recipe for the most delicious pumpkin pie I had ever seen and decided I needed to make it this year. I adapted this recipe from https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bruleed-bourbon-maple-pumpkin-pie. Mine turned out ALMOST perfect but I think next time I would add another tablespoon of butter to the crust so it would come out a little flakier. You can do the crust decoration however you please! We just had leftover from the overhang and so we decided to cut out leaves to add to the top.

                <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon rice wine(or apple cider) vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of unflavored vodka</li>
                <li>¼ cup of water</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>filling and assembly</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 15-oz. can pure pumpkin purée</li>
                <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons bourbon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of ground cloves</li>
                <li>¾ cup pure maple syrup</li>
                <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pulse cocoa powder, granulated sugar, salt, and 1¼ cups plus 1 Tbsp. flour in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces of butter remaining. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg yolk, vinegar, vodka, and ¼ cup ice water in a small bowl. Drizzle half of egg mixture over flour mixture and, using a fork, mix gently just until combined. Add remaining egg mixture and mix until dough just comes together (you will have some unincorporated pieces).</li>
                <li>Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface, flatten slightly, and cut into quarters. Stack pieces on top of one another, placing unincorporated dry pieces of dough between layers, and press down to combine. Repeat process twice more (all pieces of dough should be incorporated at this point). Form dough into a 1”-thick disk. Wrap in plastic; chill at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Roll out disk of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 14” round. Transfer to a 9” pie dish. Lift up edge and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim, leaving about 1” overhang. Fold overhang under and crimp edge. Chill in freezer 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat oven to 350°. Line pie with parchment paper or heavy-duty foil, leaving a 1½” overhang. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until crust is dry around the edge, about 20 minutes. Remove paper and weights and brush bottom and sides of crust with 1 beaten egg. Return to oven and bake until dry and set, about 3 minutes longer. (Brushing crust with egg and baking will prevent a soggy crust.)</li>
                <li>Add pumpkin purée, sour cream, bourbon, cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and remaining 3 eggs into a food processor. Pulse until completely mixed. Add mixture to a large bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour maple syrup in a small saucepan; add vanilla extract and bring syrup to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened and small puffs of steam start to release. Remove from heat and add cream in 3 additions, stirring with a wooden spoon after each addition until smooth. Gradually whisk hot maple cream into pumpkin mixture.</li>
                <li>Place pie dish on a rimmed baking sheet and pour in filling. Bake pie, rotating halfway through, until set around edge but center barely jiggles, 50–60 minutes. Transfer pie dish to a wire rack and let pie cool.</li>
            </ol>
